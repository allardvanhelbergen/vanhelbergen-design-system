# @vanhelbergen/design-system

This Allard's design system site. Because he's a nerd that likes that kind of stuff. 
Also spaces, not tabs. Just sayin'. 2 spaces, mind you. 

Moving on...

## All the things

- `yarn` installs all the things
- `yarn develop` hot reloading all the things

## Catalog

This site is run by Catalog. For more details, check out the 
[documentation](https://docs.catalog.style/).

To get started immediately, check out the `catalog/` directory.

- `PAGE_NAME.md`: Markdown files per page.
- `index.js`: The entry file to start Catalog. Change configuration and add pages here.
- `index.html`: The HTML document which gets served. Usually there's no need to edit this unless 
for example you want to load a custom font.
- `static/`: A directory with files that are served statically. For example the Catalog logo above.
